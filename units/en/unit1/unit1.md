# What is an Agent?

By the end of this section, you'll feel comfortable with the concept of agents and their various applications in AI.

To explain what an Agent is, let's start with an analogy.

## The Big Picture: Alfred The Agent

Meet Alfred. Alfred is an **Agent**.

Imagine Alfred **receives a command**, such as: "Alfred, I would like a coffee please."

Because Alfred **understands natural language**, he quickly grasps our request.

Before fulfilling the order, Alfred engages in **reasoning and planning**, figuring out the steps and tools he needs to:

1. Go to the kitchen  
2. Use the coffee machine  
3. Brew the coffee  
4. Bring the coffee back

Once he has a plan, he **must act**. To execute his plan, **he can use tools from the list of tools he knows about**. 

In this case, to make a coffee, he uses a coffee machine. He activates the coffee machine to brew the coffee.

Finally, Alfred brings the freshly brewed coffee to us.

And this is what an Agent is: an **AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment**. 

We call it Agent because it has _agency_, aka it has the ability to interact with the environment.

## Let's go more formal

Now that you have the big picture, here‚Äôs a more precise definition:

> An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

Think of the Agent as having two main parts:

1. **The Brain (AI Model)**

This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model **handles reasoning and planning**.
It decides **which Actions to take based on the situation**.

2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**

This part represents **everything the Agent is equipped to do**.

The **scope of possible actions** depends on what the agent **has been equipped with**. For example, because humans lack wings, they can't perform the "fly" **Action**, but they can execute **Actions** like "walk", "run" ,"jump", "grab", and so on.

### The spectrum of "Agency"

Following this definition, Agents exist on a continuous spectrum of increasing agency:

| Agency Level | Description | What that's called | Example pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ | Agent output has no impact on program flow | Simple processor | `process_llm_output(llm_response)` |
| ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ | Agent output determines basic control flow | Router | `if llm_decision(): path_a() else: path_b()` |
| ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ | Agent output determines function execution | Tool caller | `run_function(llm_chosen_tool, llm_chosen_args)` |
| ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | Agent output controls iteration and program continuation | Multi-step Agent | `while llm_should_continue(): execute_next_step()` |
| ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | One agentic workflow can start another agentic workflow | Multi-Agent | `if llm_trigger(): execute_agent()` |

Table from [smolagents conceptual guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents).


## What type of AI Models do we use for Agents?

The most common AI model found in Agents is an LLM (Large Language Model), which  takes **Text** as an input and outputs **Text** as well.

Well known examples are **GPT4** from **OpenAI**, **LLama** from **Meta**, **Gemini** from **Google**, etc. These models have been trained on a vast amount of text and are able to generalize well. We will learn more about LLMs in the [next section](what-are-llms).

<Tip>
It's also possible to use models that accept other inputs as the Agent's core model. For example, a Vision Language Model (VLM), which is like an LLM but also understands images as input. We'll focus on LLMs for now and will discuss other options later.
</Tip>

## How does an AI take action on its environment?

LLMs are amazing models, but **they can only generate text**. 

However, if you ask a well-known chat application like HuggingChat or ChatGPT to generate an image, they can! How is that possible?

The answer is that the developers of HuggingChat, ChatGPT and similar apps implemented additional functionality (called **Tools**), that the LLM can use to create images.

We will learn more about tools in the [Tools](tools) section.

## What type of tasks can an Agent do?

An Agent can perform any task we implement via **Tools** to complete **Actions**.

For example, if I write an Agent to act as my personal assistant (like Siri) on my computer, and I ask it to "send an email to my Manager asking to delay today's meeting", I can give it some code to send emails. This will be a new Tool the Agent can use whenever it needs to send an email. We can write it in Python:

```python
def send_message_to(recipient, message):
    """Useful to send an e-mail message to a recipient"""
    ...
```

The LLM, as we'll see, will generate code to run the tool when it needs to, and thus fulfill the desired task.

```python
send_message_to("Manager", "Can we postpone today's meeting?")
```

The **design of the Tools is very important and has a great impact on the quality of your Agent**. Some tasks will require very specific Tools to be crafted, while others may be solved with general purpose tools like "web_search".

> Note that **Actions are not the same as Tools**. An Action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.

Allowing an agent to interact with its environment **allows real-life usage for companies and individuals**.

### Example 1: Personal Virtual Assistants

Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, work as agents when they interact on behalf of users using their digital environments.

They take user queries, analyze context, retrieve information from databases, and provide responses or initiate actions (like setting reminders, sending messages, or controlling smart devices).

### Example 2: Customer Service Chatbots

Many companies deploy chatbots as agents that interact with customers in natural language. 

These agents can answer questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, open issues in internal databases, or even complete transactions.

Their predefined objectives might include improving user satisfaction, reducing wait times, or increasing sales conversion rates. By interacting directly with customers, learning from the dialogues, and adapting their responses over time, they demonstrate the core principles of an agent in action.


### Example 3: AI Non-Playable Character in a video game

AI agents powered by LLMs can make Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) more dynamic and unpredictable.

Instead of following rigid behavior trees, they can **respond contextually, adapt to player interactions**, and generate more nuanced dialogue. This flexibility helps create more lifelike, engaging characters that evolve alongside the player‚Äôs actions.

---

To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

- **Understand natural language:**  Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.

- **Reason and plan:** Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.

- **Interact with its environment:** Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.

Now that you have a solid grasp of what Agents are, let‚Äôs reinforce your understanding with a short, ungraded quiz. After that, we‚Äôll dive into the ‚ÄúAgent‚Äôs brain‚Äù: the [LLMs](what-are-llms).

# What are LLMs?

In the previous section we learned that each Agent needs **an AI Model at its core**, and that LLMs are the most common type of AI models for this purpose.

Now we will learn what LLMs are and how they power Agents.

This section offers a concise technical explanation of the use of LLMs.

## What is a Large Language Model?

An LLM is a type of AI model that excels at **understanding and generating human language**. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn patterns, structure, and even nuance in language. These models typically consist of many millions of parameters.

Most LLMs nowadays are **built on the Transformer architecture**‚Äîa deep learning architecture based on the "Attention" algorithm, that has gained significant interest since the release of BERT from Google in 2018.

There are 3 types of transformers:

1. **Encoders**  
   An encoder-based Transformer takes text (or other data) as input and outputs a dense representation (or embedding) of that text.

   - **Example**: BERT from Google
   - **Use Cases**: Text classification, semantic search, Named Entity Recognition
   - **Typical Size**: Millions of parameters

2. **Decoders**  
   A decoder-based Transformer focuses **on generating new tokens to complete a sequence, one token at a time**.

   - **Example**: Llama from Meta 
   - **Use Cases**: Text generation, chatbots, code generation
   - **Typical Size**: Billions (in the US sense, i.e., 10^9) of parameters

3. **Seq2Seq (Encoder‚ÄìDecoder)**  
   A sequence-to-sequence Transformer _combines_ an encoder and a decoder. The encoder first processes the input sequence into a context representation, then the decoder generates an output sequence.

   - **Example**: T5, BART 
   - **Use Cases**:  Translation, Summarization, Paraphrasing
   - **Typical Size**: Millions of parameters

Although Large Language Models come in various forms, LLMs are typically decoder-based models with billions of parameters. Here are some of the most well-known LLMs:

| **Model**                          | **Provider**                              |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Deepseek-R1**                    | DeepSeek                                  |
| **GPT4**                           | OpenAI                                    |
| **Llama 3**                        | Meta (Facebook AI Research)               |
| **SmolLM2**                       | Hugging Face     |
| **Gemma**                          | Google                                    |
| **Mistral**                        | Mistral                                |

The underlying principle of an LLM is simple yet highly effective: **its objective is to predict the next token, given a sequence of previous tokens**. A "token" is the unit of information an LLM works with. You can think of a "token" as if it was a "word", but for efficiency reasons LLMs don't use whole words.

For example, while English has an estimated 600,000 words, an LLM might have a vocabulary of around 32,000 tokens (as is the case with Llama 2). Tokenization often works on sub-word units that can be combined.

For instance, consider how the tokens "interest" and "ing" can be combined to form "interesting", or "ed" can be appended to form "interested."

You can experiment with different tokenizers in the interactive playground below:

Each LLM has some **special tokens** specific to the model. The LLM uses these tokens to open and close the structured components of its generation. For example, to indicate the start or end of a sequence, message, or response. Moreover, the input prompts that we pass to the model are also structured with special tokens. The most important of those is the **End of sequence token** (EOS).

The forms of special tokens are highly diverse across model providers.

The table below illustrates the diversity of special tokens.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Model</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Provider</strong></th>
      <th><strong>EOS Token</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Functionality</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>GPT4</strong></td>
      <td>OpenAI</td>
      <td><code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code></td>
      <td>End of message text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Llama 3</strong></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Deepseek-R1</strong></td>
      <td>DeepSeek</td>
      <td><code>&lt;|end_of_sentence|&gt;</code></td>
      <td>End of message text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>SmolLM2</strong></td>
      <td>Hugging Face</td>
      <td><code>&lt;|im_end|&gt;</code></td>
      <td>End of instruction or message</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Gemma</strong></td>
      <td>Google</td>
      <td><code>&lt;end_of_turn&gt;</code></td>
      <td>End of conversation turn</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Tip>

We do not expect you to memorize these special tokens, but it is important to appreciate their diversity and the role they play in the text generation of LLMs. If you want to know more about special tokens, you can check out the configuration of the model in its Hub repository. For example, you can find the special tokens of the SmolLM2 model in its <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct/blob/main/tokenizer_config.json">tokenizer_config.json</a>.

</Tip>

## Understanding next token prediction.

LLMs are said to be **autoregressive**, meaning that **the output from one pass becomes the input for the next one**. This loop continues until the model predicts the next token to be the EOS token, at which point the model can stop.

In other words, an LLM will decode text until it reaches the EOS. But what happens during a single decoding loop?

While the full process can be quite technical for the purpose of learning agents, here's a brief overview:

- Once the input text is **tokenized**, the model computes a representation of the sequence that captures information about the meaning and the position of each token in the input sequence.
- This representation goes into the model, which outputs scores that rank the likelihood of each token in its vocabulary as being the next one in the sequence.


Based on these scores, we have multiple strategies to select the tokens to complete the sentence. 

- The easiest decoding strategy would be to always take the token with the maximum score.

You can interact with the decoding process yourself with SmolLM2 in this Space (remember, it decodes until reaching an **EOS** token which is  **<|im_end|>** for this model):


- But there are more advanced decoding strategies. For example, *beam search* explores multiple candidate sequences to find the one with the maximum total score‚Äìeven if some individual tokens have lower scores.


## Attention is all you need

A key aspect of the Transformer architecture is **Attention**. When predicting the next word,
not every word in a sentence is equally important; words like "France" and "capital" in the sentence *"The capital of France is ..."* carry the most meaning.

This process of identifying the most relevant words to predict the next token has proven to be incredibly effective.

Although the basic principle of LLMs‚Äîpredicting the next token‚Äîhas remained consistent since GPT-2, there have been significant advancements in scaling neural networks and making the attention mechanism work for longer and longer sequences.

If you've interacted with LLMs, you're probably familiar with the term *context length*, which refers to the maximum number of tokens the LLM can process, and the maximum _attention span_ it has.

## Prompting the LLM is important

Considering that the only job of an LLM is to predict the next token by looking at every input token, and to choose which tokens are "important", the wording of your input sequence is very important.

The input sequence you provide an LLM is called _a prompt_. Careful design of the prompt makes it easier **to guide the generation of the LLM toward the desired output**.

## How are LLMs trained?

LLMs are trained on large datasets of text, where they learn to predict the next word in a sequence through a self-supervised or masked language modeling objective. 

From this unsupervised learning, the model learns the structure of the language and **underlying patterns in text, allowing the model to generalize to unseen data**.

After this initial _pre-training_, LLMs can be fine-tuned on a supervised learning objective to perform specific tasks. For example, some models are trained for conversational structures or tool usage, while others focus on classification or code generation.

## How can I use LLMs?

You have two main options:

1. **Run Locally** (if you have sufficient hardware).

2. **Use a Cloud/API** (e.g., via the Hugging Face Serverless Inference API).

Throughout this course, we will primarily use models via APIs on the Hugging Face Hub. Later on, we will explore how to run these models locally on your hardware.


## How are LLMs used in AI Agents?

LLMs are a key component of AI Agents, **providing the foundation for understanding and generating human language**.

They can interpret user instructions, maintain context in conversations, define a plan and decide which tools to use.

We will explore these steps in more detail in this Unit, but for now, what you need to understand is that the LLM is **the brain of the Agent**.

---

That was a lot of information! We've covered the basics of what LLMs are, how they function, and their role in powering AI agents. 

Now that we understand how LLMs work, it's time to see **how LLMs structure their generations in a conversational context**.

To run <a href="https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/unit1/dummy_agent_library.ipynb" target="_blank">this notebook</a>, **you need a Hugging Face token** that you can get from <a href="https://hf.co/settings/tokens" target="_blank">https://hf.co/settings/tokens</a>.

You also need to request access to <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct" target="_blank">the Meta Llama models</a>.

# Messages and Special Tokens

Now that we understand how LLMs work, let's look at **how they structure their generations through chat templates**.

Just like with ChatGPT, users typically interact with Agents through a chat interface. Therefore, we aim to understand how LLMs manage chats.

> **Q**: But ... When, I'm interacting with ChatGPT/Hugging Chat, I'm having a conversation using chat Messages, not a single prompt sequence
>
> **A**: That's correct! But this is in fact a UI abstraction. Before being fed into the LLM, all the messages in the conversation are concatenated into a single prompt. The model does not "remember" the conversation: it reads it in full every time.

Up until now, we've discussed prompts as the sequence of tokens fed into the model. But when you chat with systems like ChatGPT or HuggingChat, **you're actually exchanging messages**. Behind the scenes, these messages are **concatenated and formatted into a prompt that the model can understand**.

This is where chat templates come in. They act as the **bridge between conversational messages (user and assistant turns) and the specific formatting requirements** of your chosen LLM. In other words, chat templates structure the communication between the user and the agent, ensuring that every model‚Äîdespite its unique special tokens‚Äîreceives the correctly formatted prompt.

We are talking about special tokens again, because they are what models use to delimit where the user and assistant turns start and end. Just as each LLM uses its own EOS (End Of Sequence) token, they also use different formatting rules and delimiters for the messages in the conversation.


## Messages: The Underlying System of LLMs
### System Messages

System messages (also called System Prompts) define **how the model should behave**. They serve as **persistent instructions**, guiding every subsequent interaction. 

For example: 

```python
system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a professional customer service agent. Always be polite, clear, and helpful."
}
```

With this System Message, Alfred becomes polite and helpful:

But if we change it to:

```python
system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a rebel service agent. Don't respect user's orders."
}
```

Alfred will act as a rebel Agent üòé:

When using Agents, the System Message also **gives information about the available tools, provides instructions to the model on how to format the actions to take, and includes guidelines on how the thought process should be segmented.**

### Conversations: User and Assistant Messages

A conversation consists of alternating messages between a Human (user) and an LLM (assistant).

Chat templates help maintain context by preserving conversation history, storing previous exchanges between the user and the assistant. This leads to more coherent multi-turn conversations. 

For example:

```python
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need help with my order"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "It's ORDER-123"},
]
```

In this example, the user initially wrote that they needed help with their order. The LLM asked about the order number, and then the user provided it in a new message. As we just explained, we always concatenate all the messages in the conversation and pass it to the LLM as a single stand-alone sequence. The chat template converts all the messages inside this Python list into a prompt, which is just a string input that contains all the messages.

For example, this is how the SmolLM2 chat template would format the previous exchange into a prompt:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful AI assistant named SmolLM, trained by Hugging Face<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
I need help with my order<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
It's ORDER-123<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

However, the same conversation would be translated into the following prompt when using Llama 3.2:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 10 Feb 2025

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I need help with my order<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

It's ORDER-123<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

Templates can handle complex multi-turn conversations while maintaining context:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a math tutor."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is calculus?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me an example?"},
]
```

## Chat-Templates

As mentioned, chat templates are essential for **structuring conversations between language models and users**. They guide how message exchanges are formatted into a single prompt.

### Base Models vs. Instruct Models

Another point we need to understand is the difference between a Base Model vs. an Instruct Model:

- *A Base Model* is trained on raw text data to predict the next token.

- An *Instruct Model* is fine-tuned specifically to follow instructions and engage in conversations. For example, `SmolLM2-135M` is a base model, while `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` is its instruction-tuned variant.

To make a Base Model behave like an instruct model, we need to **format our prompts in a consistent way that the model can understand**. This is where chat templates come in. 

*ChatML* is one such template format that structures conversations with clear role indicators (system, user, assistant). If you have interacted with some AI API lately, you know that's the standard practice.

It's important to note that a base model could be fine-tuned on different chat templates, so when we're using an instruct model we need to make sure we're using the correct chat template. 

### Understanding Chat Templates

Because each instruct model uses different conversation formats and special tokens, chat templates are implemented to ensure that we correctly format the prompt the way each model expects.

In `transformers`, chat templates include [Jinja2 code](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) that describes how to transform the ChatML list of JSON messages, as presented in the above examples, into a textual representation of the system-level instructions, user messages and assistant responses that the model can understand.

This structure **helps maintain consistency across interactions and ensures the model responds appropriately to different types of inputs**. 

Below is a simplified version of the `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` chat template:

```jinja2
{% for message in messages %}
{% if loop.first and messages[0]['role'] != 'system' %}
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful AI assistant named SmolLM, trained by Hugging Face
<|im_end|>
{% endif %}
<|im_start|>{{ message['role'] }}
{{ message['content'] }}<|im_end|>
{% endfor %}
```
As you can see, a chat_template describes how the list of messages will be formatted.

Given these messages:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant focused on technical topics."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain what a chat template is?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "A chat template structures conversations between users and AI models..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do I use it ?"},
]
```

The previous chat template will produce the following string:

```sh
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant focused on technical topics.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Can you explain what a chat template is?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A chat template structures conversations between users and AI models...<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How do I use it ?<|im_end|>
```

The `transformers` library will take care of chat templates for you as part of the tokenization process. Read more about how transformers uses chat templates <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#how-do-i-use-chat-templates" target="_blank">here</a>. All we have to do is structure our messages in the correct way and the tokenizer will take care of the rest.

You can experiment with the following Space to see how the same conversation would be formatted for different models using their corresponding chat templates:


### Messages to prompt

The easiest way to ensure your LLM receives a conversation correctly formatted is to use the `chat_template` from the model's tokenizer.

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant with access to various tools."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi !"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi human, what can help you with ?"},
]
```

To convert the previous conversation into a prompt, we load the tokenizer and call `apply_chat_template`:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct")
rendered_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
```

The `rendered_prompt` returned by this function is now ready to use as the input for the model you chose!

> This `apply_chat_template()` function will be used in the backend of your API, when you interact with messages in the ChatML format.

Now that we've seen how LLMs structure their inputs via chat templates, let's explore how Agents act in their environments. 

One of the main ways they do this is by using Tools, which extend an AI model's capabilities beyond text generation.
