# Introduction to the Agents Bootcamp

Welcome to the most exciting topic in AI today: **Agents**!

This bootcamp will take you on a journey, **from beginner to expert**, in understanding, using and building AI agents.

This first unit will help you onboard, Let's get started!

## What to expect from this course? [[expect]]

In this course, you will:

- üìñ Study AI Agents in **theory, design, and practice.**
- üßë‚Äçüíª Learn to **use established AI Agent libraries** such as [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).
- üíæ **Share your agents** and explore agents created by the community.
- üèÜ Participate in challenges where you will **evaluate your agents against others'.**

At the end of this course, you'll understand **how Agents work and how to build your own Agents using the latest libraries and tools**.

## What does the course look like? [[course-look-like]]

The course is composed of:

- *Foundational Units*: where you learn Agents **concepts in theory**.
- *Hands-on*: where you'll learn **to use established AI Agent libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on sections will be **Hugging Face Spaces** with a pre-configured environment.
- *Use case assignments*: where you'll apply the concepts you've learned to solve a real-world problem that you'll choose.
- *The Challenge*: you'll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Students_leaderboard) for you to compare the agents' performance.

## What's the syllabus? [[syllabus]]

Here is the **general syllabus for the course**. A more detailed list of topics will be released with each unit.
